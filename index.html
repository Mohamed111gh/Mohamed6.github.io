        <p>Hi, My name is Mohamed, i was born and raised in Tripoli, Libya, if you don't know where that is, don't feel bad because most people don't, libya is a big country with low population with over 70% being pure desert, this means i am used to hot and dry weather, so you know coming to canada was a mistake. </p>
